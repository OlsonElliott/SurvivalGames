SurvivalGames
=============

This Github is to ensure that I have every change tracked to ensure that in the case code were to start not working. I would have a earlier version, of the code working.
If necessary I would be able to download from that point, and recode the feature that broke the plugin.

This code will be used for the Offical CoronaMC Network, that is run by ElliottOlson

If this code is used in other areas than this, legal action may be used.
